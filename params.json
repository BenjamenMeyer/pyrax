{"name":"Pyrax","tagline":"The Python SDK for OpenStack and the Rackspace Cloud","body":"#pyrax\r\nPython SDK for OpenStack/Rackspace APIs\r\n\r\nSee the COPYING file for license and copyright information.\r\n\r\n**pyrax** should work with most OpenStack-based cloud deployments, though it specifically targets the Rackspace public cloud. For example, the code for cloudfiles contains the ability to publish your content on Rackspace's CDN network, even though CDN support is not part of OpenStack Swift. But if you don't use any of the CDN-related code, your app will work fine on any standard Swift deployment.\r\n\r\nSee the [Release Notes](https://github.com/rackspace/pyrax/tree/master/RELEASENOTES.md) for what has changed in the latest release\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rackspace/pyrax.png)](https://travis-ci.org/rackspace/pyrax)\r\n\r\n##Getting Started with OpenStack/Rackspace\r\nTo sign up for a Rackspace Cloud account, go to\r\n\r\n[http://www.rackspace.com/cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud)\r\n\r\nand follow the prompts.\r\n\r\nIf you are working with an OpenStack deployment, you can find more information at [http://www.openstack.org](http://www.openstack.org).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* A Rackspace Cloud account\r\n\t* username\r\n\t* API key\r\n* Python 2.7\r\n\t* pyrax is not yet tested yet with other Python versions. Please post feedback about what works or does not work with other versions. See the **Support and Feedback** section below for where to post.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nThe best way to install **pyrax** is by using [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/) to get the latest official release:\r\n\r\n\tpip install pyrax\r\n\r\nIf you would like to work with the current development state of pyrax, you can install directly from trunk on GitHub:\r\n\r\n\tpip install git+git://github.com/rackspace/pyrax.git\r\n\r\nIf you are not using [virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv), you will need to run `pip install` as admin using `sudo`.\r\n\r\nYou may also download and install from source. The source code for **pyrax** is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/rackspace/pyrax/).\r\n\r\nOnce you have the source code, `cd` to the base directory of the source and run (using `sudo`, if necessary):\r\n\r\n\tpython setup.py install\r\n\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\nIf you installed **pyrax** using pip, it is simple to get the latest updates from either PyPI or GitHub:\r\n\r\n\t# PyPI\r\n\tpip install --upgrade pyrax\r\n\t# GitHub\r\n\tpip install --upgrade git+git://github.com/rackspace/pyrax.git\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nPlease see the HACKING file for contribution guidelines. Make sure pull requests are on the `working` branch!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Support and Feedback\r\nYou can find documentation for using the **pyrax** SDK at [docs.rackspace.com](http://docs.rackspace.com/sdks/guide/content/python.html).\r\n\r\nYour feedback is appreciated! If you have specific issues with the **pyrax** SDK, developers should file an [issue via Github](https://github.com/rackspace/pyrax/issues).\r\n\r\nFor general feedback and support requests, send an email to: <sdk-support@rackspace.com>.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
